A somewhat buggy version of tetris in text art made whilst bored in GCSE computer science lessons,
as such it is designed to run on school computers which is why it has no graphics.
There is one tetromino missing. Can you figure out which?
I made this to kill time, not as a proper elegant implementation. I don't think the code is too terrible but don't expect wonders.
